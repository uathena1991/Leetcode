Problem:

There is a garden with N slots. In each slot, there is a flower. The N flowers will bloom one by one in N days. In each day, there will be exactly one flower blooming and it will be in the status of blooming since then.

Given an array flowers consists of number from 1 to N. Each number in the array represents the place where the flower will open in that day.

For example, flowers[i] = x means that the unique flower that blooms at day i will be at position x, where i and x will be in the range from 1 to N.

Also given an integer k, you need to output in which day there exists two flowers in the status of blooming, and also the number of flowers between them is k and these flowers are not blooming.

If there isnâ€™t such day, output -1.

Example 1:

Input:
flowers: [1,3,2]
k: 1
Output: 2
Explanation: In the second day, the first and the third flower have become blooming.
Example 2:

Input:
flowers: [1,2,3]
k: 1
Output: -1
Note:

The given array will be in the range [1, 20000].




Solution:
days[i]: the ith flower blooms on day i
check every subinterval [left:left+k+1], if the bloom days in between (left, left + k + 1) > max(days[left], days[right]), it's a suitable solution,
return max(days[left], days[right]);
else, check the next subinterval start from curr location.
